## What is destamatic‑ui?

destamatic‑ui is the top layer of the **destam stack**:

- **destam** – fine‑grained Observer based state management (`Observer`, `OObject`, `OArray`, etc.).
- **destam-dom** – DOM manipulation with direct Observer based updates (**no virtual DOM**).
- **destamatic‑ui** – batteries‑included framework built on top:
  - component library
  - routing & stages
  - static site generation / SEO helpers
  - theming system
  - rich text
  - icons and other utilities

Most apps can import almost everything they need from `destamatic-ui` and ignore the other packages until they want lower‑level control.

## Who is this for?

- **Indie devs / solo SaaS / small teams**  
  Tired of stitching React + Next + Zustand + MUI + Redux + 5 other libs. You want a single stack that just works.

- **Performance / architecture nerds**  
  You like Solid/Svelte/signals and care about fine‑grained reactivity and benchmarkable performance.

- **JS devs bored with React overhead**  
  Comfortable with JSX, want a smaller mental model, less boilerplate, and a live playground to try things before committing.

## Key features

- 🧩 **Built‑in component library** – buttons, inputs, layout, navigation, utilities.
- 🎨 **“Hell and back” theming** – deeply composable, context‑based theming with inheritance and helpers.
- 🧭 **Routing & stages** – simple page routing and stage management.
- 📄 **Static site / SEO tooling** – `<Head>`, `<Title>`, `<Meta>`, `<Link>`, JSON‑LD helpers; works with SSG.
- ✏️ **Rich text engine** – `RichArea`, `RichField`, `RichEngine`, `TextModifiers` for custom inline rendering.
- 🖼️ **Icons** – built‑in support for multiple icon sets & custom icons.
- 🧬 **Observer‑based state** – fine‑grained updates, watchers, delta mutations, network‑sync patterns.
- ⚡ **No VDOM** – `destam-dom` updates real DOM directly, tuned for large lists and high‑frequency updates.
- 🏭 **Production‑proven** – destam stack has been used in production for 5+ years (Equator Studios + personal projects like torrin.me, OpenGig.org, MangoSync).

## Try it online

You can play with the stack in the browser before installing anything:

- **Landing & overview:** https://torrin.me/destamatic-ui  
- **Interactive Playground:** https://torrin.me/destamatic-ui/playground  
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: https://torrin.me/destamatic-ui/docs

The playground includes live examples for:

- destam (Observers),
- destam‑dom (DOM bindings),
- destamatic‑ui (components, theming, utils).

## Installation

`destamatic-ui` is published on npm and designed for Vite.

```bash
npm install destamatic-ui
# or
yarn add destamatic-ui
# or
pnpm add destamatic-ui
```

Basic usage:

```jsx
import { Observer } from 'destam';
import { mount } from 'destam-dom';
import { h, Paper, Button, Typography } from 'destamatic-ui';

const count = Observer.mutable(0);

const App = () => <Paper theme="column_fill_center" style={{ gap: 12, padding: 24 }}>
    <Typography type="h3" label="Counter" />
    <Typography type="p1" label={count.map((c) => `Value: ${c}`)} />
    <Button
      type="contained"
      label="Increment"
      onClick={() => count.set(count.get() + 1)}
    />
</Paper>;

mount(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);
```
