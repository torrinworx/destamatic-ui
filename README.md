A lightweight component library powered by `destam` and `destam-dom`.

</div>

---

Destamatic UI is a UI library built on the delta state management library [destam](https://github.com/equator-studios/destam) and the DOM manipulation library [destam-dom](https://github.com/Nefsen402/destam-dom). The base set of components take inspiration from MUI and the base HTML tags, with some ease-of-use built in.

## Features Overview
Destamatic UI offers a range of components designed for responsive and interactive web interfaces. Key features include:

- **State Management Integration:** Built on `destam`, effortless state management across components.
- **Built in reactivity:** Uses `destam-dom` for efficient DOM manipulations and updates without the need for a virtual dom.
- **Theming:** Customizable and reactive theming for consistent, application-wide style and appearance.
- **Component Library:** Includes navigational, input, and display components inspired by material design principles.

For a detailed overview of the components and their functionalities, refer to the [documentation](./docs/index.md).

## Demo
You can install and run the demo with the following steps:
1. Clone the library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/torrinworx/destamatic-ui.git
```

This will start the Vite demo server on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/). You can view example components based on their directory paths in the `examples` folder. Here's how you can access them:

- `examples/inputs/button.jsx`, can bee seen by going to:
	- [http://localhost:5173/inputs/button.html](http://localhost:5173/inputs/button.html)
- `examples/utils/theme.jsx`, can bee seen by going to:
	- [http://localhost:5173/utils/theme.html](http://localhost:5173/utils/theme.html)

Replace the path with the corresponding directory and file name, adjusting for any additional examples you want to explore.
